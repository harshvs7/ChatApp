Hello Everyone,
I have built a iOS Chat Application using which you can use to chat with your friends, send them photos, videos and locations. 
I have built this using UIKit for UI, Foundation for logic, MapKit and CoreLocation for location sending, AVKit and PhotosUI for media handling and Firebase for chat Database. 
Have integrated Firebase Ananlytics and Authentication for safe login and registration feature. 
I am working on adding more things to it and make it better.
Feel free to take clone for looking at the code and do tell me your insights.
